# Task 4. Average Post Hiatus (Part 1)

Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

Example Output:

user_id	days_between

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

Hint #1

Do you know how to obtain the last and first post per user? Try using the MIN and MAX functions, and then substract one from another.

Find more info about MAX and MIN functions.

Hint #2
First, DATE_PART is a useful function to extract a part of a date (e.g. day, month, year) from a given input date. Read more here

Check the code snippet below and replace 'part' with the desired granularity.

DATE_PART('part', post_date)
Psst, note that we can't use DATEDIFF and TIMESTAMPDIFF functions as these are MySQL's functions.

Hint #3
To focus on the users who have posted more than once, you can COUNT the number of posts and exclude users with 1 post only. What do you think, should you use HAVING or WHERE for this?

To offer some background, HAVING clause applies to the group as whole, while WHERE applies to individual rows.

What should I find?
--find first post: MIN()
--find last post: MAX()
--count days between max and min (2 options)
--filter by year 2021 extract(year from post_date)
--output used_id and days_between ()
--user should have at least 2 post or >1.

Solution 1 (with CTE - Common Table Expression):
```sql
WITH user_posts_2021 AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    MIN(post_date) AS first_post,
    MAX(post_date) AS last_post,
    COUNT(post_id) AS post_count
  FROM posts
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM post_date) = 2021
  GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT
  user_id,
  DATE_PART('day', last_post - first_post) AS days_between
FROM user_posts_2021
WHERE post_count >= 2;
```

Solution 2:
```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  MAX(post_date::DATE) - MIN(post_date::DATE) AS days_between
FROM posts
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM post_date) = 2021
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(post_id) >1
;
```

Output
user_id	days_between
151652	307
661093	206
