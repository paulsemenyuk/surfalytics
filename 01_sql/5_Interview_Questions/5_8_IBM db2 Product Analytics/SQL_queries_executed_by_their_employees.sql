WITH employee_queries AS (
  SELECT
    e.employee_id,
    COALESCE(COUNT(DISTINCT q.query_id), 0) AS unique_queries
  FROM employees AS e
  LEFT JOIN queries AS q
    ON e.employee_id = q.employee_id
      AND q.query_starttime >= '2023-07-01T00:00:00Z'
      AND q.query_starttime < '2023-10-01T00:00:00Z'
  GROUP BY e.employee_id
)

SELECT
  unique_queries,
  COUNT(employee_id) AS employee_count
FROM employee_queries
GROUP BY unique_queries
ORDER BY unique_queries;
