| 1       | Toy Train      | John      | 2.5       |

### **Hints:**
- Use `SUM()` to calculate the total weight of gifts for each recipient.
- Group the results by `recipient` to get totals per individual.

### **Expected Output:**
| recipient | total_weight_kg |
|-----------|-----------------|
| John      | 3.4             |
| Alice     | 0.8             |
| Sophia    | 1.2             |
