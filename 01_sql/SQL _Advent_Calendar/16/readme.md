### **Hints:**
- Multiply `quantity_sold` by `price_per_unit` to calculate revenue for each sale.
- Group your results by the `category` column and use the `SUM()` function to get total revenue.

### **Expected Output:**
| category   | total_revenue |
|-------------|--------------|
| Sweets      | 60           |
| Chocolate   | 110          |
